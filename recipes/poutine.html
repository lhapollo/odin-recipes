    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying.</li>
      <li>1 (10.25 ounce) can beef gravy</li>
      <li>5 medium potatoes, cut into fries</li>
      <li>2 cups cheese curds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a deep fryer or deep heavy skillet to 365 degrees F (185
        degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>While the oil is heating, begin to warm gravy.</li>
      <li>
        Place fries into the hot oil, and cook until light brown, 8 to 10
        minutes. Cook fries in batches if necessary to allow them room to move a
        little in the oil. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
      </li>
      <li>Place fries on a serving platter, and sprinkle cheese over them.</li>
      <li>
        Ladle warmed gravy over the fries and cheese, and serve immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
